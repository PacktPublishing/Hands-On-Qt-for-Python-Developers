This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore PyQt5 and PySide2 to create comprehensive GUI applications 
* Find out how threading and multiprocessing work 
* Understand how to style GUIs with PyQt 
* Get to grips with implementing buttons 
* Understand how elements communicate with signals, slots, and event handlers 
* Explore mobile development with PyQt and PySide
